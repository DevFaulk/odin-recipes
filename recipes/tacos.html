            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Birria, a.k.a. tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its braising liquid until it reaches a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Traditionally, it gets its flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul></ul>
                <li><strong>Dried chile peppers</strong>: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Beef</strong>: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
                <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Vinegar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Tortillas</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion</strong> and <strong>Cilantro</strong>: Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
                <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
                <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
                <li>Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.</li>
                <li>Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.</li>
                <li>Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.</li>
